Hello <%= @user.best_name %>,
  
Someone, perhaps you, has entered your email address into the 'forgotten password' form on the Croucher Foundation website.

If that person was not you, please don't be concerned: you are receiving this message and they are not. Please ignore it and carry on as usual.
  
If you would like to change your password, please go to this address:
  
    <%= edit_password_url(@resource, :reset_password_token => @resource.reset_password_token) %>
  
Your password will not change until you complete this process, so if you have just remembered it you can still log in as usual here:

    <%= new_user_session_url %>

If you have any problems with the site, please let me know right away by writing to will@spanner.org or just replying to this email.
  
Best wishes,

Will
(the site builder)
