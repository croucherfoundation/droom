    This confirmation url is not correct. Have you already confirmed this account? In that case
    you only need to
    = link_to("sign in", "/") + ',' 
    or possibly to 
    = link_to("reset your password", new_password_path(resource_name))
    and then sign in.
    Otherwise, please check your invitation email and make sure that you are typing or pasting the right address. 
    It may be that your email program has broken the address over two lines: in that case please make sure you enter 
    the whole thing without any spaces.
