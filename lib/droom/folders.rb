# Documents in droom are never attached directly to an object. Instead they are always attached to a folder,
# and the folder is usually attached to an object. The folder itself is a normal ActiveRecord object with a 
# name and some tree behaviours that allow us to present a filing system.
#
# This file defines the interface by which we declare that an object has a folder and would like to receive documents.
#
# It is also possible to have a loose folder: in that case it is considered public and available to everyone.
#
#TODO very old code! Rewrite as a Concern, or simplify away altogether?
